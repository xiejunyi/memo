junyi,

can you follow this instructions on the toy build and restart the build after fixing the toy build machine

voltron manifest fetch has few bugs and it fails if user changes the remote or anything else between builds
the safest thing to do is to 


ssh jenkins@10.1.3.131 -i qa-key.pem
sudo su - buildbot
cd ${toybuild}
cd build/
rm -rf *
git submodule init
git submodule update

and then from buildbot console restart the build
the windows toy build was enabled last month but disabled since it was not successful
